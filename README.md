# Turn your Express app in the API

- **_Use this app as a starter code for your project._**
- Follow these steps to clone project to your local machine:

```shell
$ svn export https://github.com/Ironhack-Miami-PTWD-October-2019/module-3/branches/master/API-awesome-ptwd-library-project
$ cd API-awesome-ptwd-library-project
# if you don't have .env: touch .env
# add to .env: PORT = 3001
# if you have .env, change port from 3000 to 3001
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

- To test your app, go to Postman. Now your routes will start with: `http://localhost:3001/`
